# Remaking the todo list

## Originally made using vanilla JS, the goal is to take this project https://codepen.io/Krmanski/pen/bGjNBMG?editors=0100 and rebuild it using typescript, react, and with a wiser eye for code than I had a couple months ago. 

**Broad TODO list for....todo list**
-map out what components will need to be built
-put together dummy layout of components to make them at least appear in the right place
-ensure that local storage works with this stack
-correctly type all of my code
-write tests to ensure the code is doing what it must do.


//TODO: write something later to make sure it cannot add a taks if a that task already exists in said project


//TODO: make sure that the EDIT project forms actually change the existing project in state when a new name is submitted. Right now they just make new projects, but they should overrite the old ones.

//TODO: All this stuff:
-clean up logs and alerts
-prettier
-make the headline have something in it by default when no project is selected
-in general, this is buggy and doesn't always update when projects delete, get edited.
-better color scheme
-better layout
-make responsive
