# Remaking the todo list

## Originally made using vanilla JS, the goal is to take this project https://codepen.io/Krmanski/pen/bGjNBMG?editors=0100 and rebuild it using typescript, react, and with a wiser eye for code than I had a couple months ago. 


**TODO LIST FOR....todo list app**


//TODO: All this stuff:
-clean up logs and alerts
-prettier
-make the headline have something in it by default when no project is selected
-in general, this is buggy and doesn't always update when projects delete, get edited.
-better color scheme
-better layout
-make responsive

TODO: layout stuff
-responsive in general
-make tasks get wider when the sidebar is hidden
